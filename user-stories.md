## MVP Description

**Secret Hitler Online - Python Web Edition**

A browser-based implementation of Secret Hitler where 1-2 human players join 6-7 AI players in a complete 8-player game. The MVP focuses on core gameplay functionality with intelligent AI opponents that exhibit distinct personalities and strategic behavior.

### MVP Core Features

**Single Game Experience**
- One active game room at a time (8 players total)

- Complete Secret Hitler ruleset with all presidential powers
- Real-time game state updates via WebSocket/polling

**Basic AI System**
- Two personality types: "Cautious Conservative" and "Bold Aggressor"
- Role-appropriate behavior (fascists coordinate subtly, liberals deduce openly)
- Simple chat responses during discussion phases
- Strategic voting and policy decisions based on game context

**Essential Interface**
- Clean game board showing policies, election tracker, player cards
- Mobile-optimized touch interface for voting and selections
- Real-time chat window with AI participation
- Clear visual feedback for game phases and available actions

**Technical Foundation**
- FastAPI backend with Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Progressive Web App for mobile installation
- In-memory game state (no user accounts required)
- Automatic game reset after completion

## User Stories

### US-001: Project Setup and Repository Initialization
**As a** developer  
**I want** to set up a Python FastAPI project structure in VS Code and commit it to GitHub  
**So that** I have a solid foundation for collaborative development with proper version control

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create new GitHub repository named "secret-hitler-online"
- [ ] Initialize Python virtual environment with Python 3.9+
- [ ] Set up FastAPI project structure with proper folder organization:
  ```
  /secret-hitler-online
    /app
      /models
      /services  
      /api
      /static
      /templates
    /tests
    requirements.txt
    main.py
    README.md
    .gitignore
  ```
- [ ] Install core dependencies: FastAPI, uvicorn, python-socketio, pydantic
- [ ] Create basic FastAPI application that serves "Hello World" on localhost:8000
- [ ] Configure VS Code workspace with Python extension and linting
- [ ] Write comprehensive README.md with setup instructions
- [ ] Commit initial project structure to main branch
- [ ] Verify application runs successfully with `uvicorn main:app --reload`

### US-002: Core Game Models and Data Structures
**As a** developer  
**I want** to implement the fundamental game models and enums  
**So that** the application can represent all game states, player roles, and game mechanics accurately

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create `models/game_models.py` with comprehensive data structures:
  - Player class (id, name, role, party, is_human, is_alive)
  - Game class (players, policies, election_tracker, current_president, etc.)
  - Enums for Role, Party, PolicyType, GamePhase, PresidentialPower
- [ ] Implement game state validation methods
- [ ] Create policy deck management (6 liberal, 11 fascist cards)
- [ ] Build election tracker with proper advancement logic
- [ ] Design player elimination system for execution power
- [ ] Add win condition detection methods for all victory scenarios
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests covering all model functionality
- [ ] Ensure all models are JSON serializable for real-time updates
- [ ] Document all classes and methods with clear docstrings

### US-003: Game Logic Engine Implementation
**As a** player  
**I want** the game to correctly enforce all Secret Hitler rules and phase transitions  
**So that** gameplay matches the official board game experience exactly

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Implement complete game flow state machine:
  - Role assignment and revelation phase
  - Election phase (nomination, voting, chancellor confirmation)
  - Legislative session (policy drawing, presidential discard, chancellor enactment)
  - Presidential power execution phase
- [ ] Build election failure handling (advance tracker, chaos scenario)
- [ ] Implement all 4 presidential powers with proper timing:
  - Investigate Loyalty (reveal player's party)
  - Call Special Election (choose next president)
  - Policy Peek (examine top 3 cards)
  - Execution (eliminate player permanently)
- [ ] Create fascist policy board effects (unlock powers at 1, 2, 3 policies)
- [ ] Enforce game rules: term limits, eligibility restrictions, Hitler chancellorship
- [ ] Handle edge cases: Hitler executed, all fascist policies enacted
- [ ] Add comprehensive game state logging for debugging
- [ ] Write integration tests covering complete game scenarios
- [ ] Ensure deterministic game outcomes for testing

### US-004: Basic AI Player Decision System
**As a** human player  
**I want** AI players to make strategic, role-appropriate decisions  
**So that** the game feels challenging and authentic with realistic opponents

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Create base AI player class with decision-making framework
- [ ] Implement two distinct AI personalities:
  - "Cautious Conservative": Plays defensively, votes carefully, minimal chat
  - "Bold Aggressor": Takes risks, votes aggressively, frequent accusations
- [ ] Build role-specific behavior patterns:
  - **Liberal AI**: Votes against suspicious players, investigates thoroughly
  - **Fascist AI**: Subtly supports fascist agenda, creates confusion
  - **Hitler AI**: Maintains liberal facade, avoids chancellorship early game
- [ ] Implement strategic voting algorithms:
  - Analyze board state and player history
  - Consider win conditions and current threats
  - Factor in personality traits and risk tolerance
- [ ] Create policy selection logic for presidents and chancellors
- [ ] Build presidential power usage strategies
- [ ] Add basic natural language responses for chat interactions
- [ ] Ensure AI decision timing feels natural (2-8 second delays)
- [ ] Test AI behavior across multiple complete games
