## Technical Stack

### Backend: Python
- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework with automatic API docs
- **Socket.IO** - Robust real-time communication with mobile support
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL** - Game state persistence
- **OpenAI API** - For advanced AI player personalities
- **asyncio** - Handle concurrent games efficiently

### Frontend: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- **Vanilla JS or Vue.js** - Lightweight, mobile-optimized
- **Socket.IO client** - Real-time game updates
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)** - Mobile app-like experience
- **CSS Grid/Flexbox** - Responsive design

### Mobile Optimization Strategy

**Real-time Communication**
- Socket.IO automatically falls back to polling if WebSockets fail
- Built-in mobile network handling and reconnection
- Efficient battery usage with smart polling intervals

**Interface Design**
- Touch-optimized buttons and voting interfaces
- Swipe gestures for card selection
- Responsive breakpoints for phone/tablet/desktop
- PWA enables "install to home screen" functionality

**Performance Considerations**
- Minimize data transfer with efficient game state updates
- Client-side game state caching
- Lazy loading of game assets

## Revised MVP Technical Specs

### Real-time Polling Strategy
1. **Primary**: WebSocket connection via Socket.IO
2. **Fallback**: Long polling every 2-5 seconds
3. **Mobile optimization**: Smart reconnection on network changes
4. **Battery efficiency**: Reduce polling frequency when game inactive

### Mobile-First Features
- **Touch interactions**: Tap to vote, swipe to select policies
- **Vibration feedback**: For important game events
- **Screen wake lock**: Keep screen active during turns
- **Offline detection**: Handle network interruptions gracefully

### Simplified Architecture Benefits
- **Faster development**: Python's simplicity speeds up game logic implementation
- **Better AI**: Easier integration with AI libraries and APIs
- **Lower complexity**: No need for heavy frameworks like .NET Core
- **Cross-platform**: Works identically on all devices and operating systems

---

**Key Mobile Testing Points**
- Test on actual devices, not just browser dev tools
- Verify touch responsiveness and gesture handling  
- Validate network interruption recovery
- Ensure PWA installation works correctly

This Python + HTML/JS approach will deliver a more robust, mobile-friendly experience with better AI capabilities and faster development cycles.
