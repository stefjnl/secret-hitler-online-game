# US-004: AI Player Implementation Plan (Revised)

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for creating an intelligent AI player system for Secret Hitler Online. The system will feature distinct personalities, strategic decision-making capabilities, and natural language communication to provide an engaging, challenging, and believable gameplay experience. This revised plan incorporates feedback to enhance strategic depth, testing, and risk mitigation.

## 2. Architecture

The AI system will be composed of the following core components:

- **`AIPlayer`**: The base class for all AI players, responsible for analyzing the game state, making decisions, and generating chat messages.
- **`AIPersonality`**: An enum or class that defines the behavioral traits of an AI player (e.g., Cautious Conservative, Bold Aggressor).
- **`GameAnalysis`**: A utility class that provides a comprehensive analysis of the game state from a specific player's perspective, including suspicion levels, win probabilities, and voting patterns.
- **`AIMemory`**: A data structure that stores the AI's knowledge about the game, including voting history, policy claims, and investigation results.
- **`AIDecisionManager`**: The central orchestrator that integrates the AI system with the `GameEngine`, requesting AI decisions and managing AI turns.

## 3. Implementation Phases

The implementation will be divided into the following phases:

### Phase 1: Foundational AI Framework (Week 1)

- **Task**: Implement the core AI classes (`AIPlayer`, `AIPersonality`, `GameAnalysis`, `AIMemory`).
- **Deliverables**:
    - `app/services/ai_players.py` file with the basic structure of the AI system.
    - Unit tests for the foundational classes.

### Phase 2: Election Phase AI Logic (Week 1)

- **Task**: Implement the AI's decision-making logic for the election phase.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `decide_chancellor_nomination` method with role-specific logic.
    - `decide_vote` method that analyzes the board state, player history, and personality traits.
    - Unit tests for the election phase logic.

### Phase 2.5: Basic Integration Checkpoint (Week 1.5)

- **Task**: Perform an early integration test with a single AI player.
- **Deliverables**:
    - A test scenario with one AI player in a full game.
    - Validation of the basic decision flow and interface compatibility.

### Phase 3: Legislative Session AI Logic (Week 2)

- **Task**: Implement the AI's decision-making logic for the legislative session.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `choose_policy_to_discard` method for the president.
    - `choose_policy_to_enact` method for the chancellor.
    - Unit tests for the legislative session logic.

### Phase 4: Presidential Power & Strategic Coordination (Week 2)

- **Task**: Implement AI logic for presidential powers and fascist coordination.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `choose_investigation_target`, `choose_execution_target`, and `choose_special_election_nominee` methods.
    - Logic for fascist players to subtly coordinate and protect Hitler.
    - Unit tests for presidential power and coordination logic.

### Phase 5: Full Integration with GameEngine (Week 3)

- **Task**: Fully integrate the AI system with the `GameEngine`.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `AIDecisionManager` class to handle communication.
    - Asynchronous decision-making with realistic delays.
    - Integration tests for AI-only and mixed human-AI games.

### Phase 6: Intelligent Communication (Week 3+)

- **Task**: Implement context-aware and deceptive communication.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `generate_chat_response` method with logic for lying and misdirection.
    - Emotional response simulation and strategic timing of messages.
    - Integration tests for the advanced chat system.

### Phase 7: Advanced Features (Post-MVP)

- **Task**: Implement advanced features like adaptive learning and difficulty scaling.
- **Deliverables**:
    - `AIDifficulty` enum and corresponding logic.
    - (Optional) `adjust_strategy_based_on_outcomes` for adaptive learning.

## 4. Testing Strategy & Success Metrics

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Verify individual component functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure correct integration with the `GameEngine`.
- **Strategic Validation**:
    - **Win Rate Analysis**: AI achieves a 40-60% win rate in assigned roles.
    - **Deception Effectiveness**: Fascist AI maintains cover successfully.
    - **Human Satisfaction**: Players rate AI opponents as "challenging" (survey score > 3.5/5).
- **AI Believability Validation**:
    - **Turing Test Scenarios**: Can human players distinguish AI from other humans?
    - **Behavioral Consistency Checks**: Does a "Cautious" AI consistently act cautiously?
- **Stress Testing**:
    - **Memory Leak Detection**: Extended gameplay sessions.
    - **Concurrent Load**: 50+ simultaneous AI players across multiple games.
    - **Decision Timeout Handling**: AI responses under network pressure.

### Success Metrics

- **Phase 2**: AI makes valid nominations/votes 95% of the time.
- **Phase 3**: AI policy decisions align with role objectives 80% of the time.
- **Phase 4**: AI power usage shows strategic thinking 70% of the time.
- **Phase 5**: Integration tests pass with <8 second response times.
- **Phase 6**: Chat messages feel contextually appropriate 75% of the time.
- **Overall MVP Success**:
    - Complete 8-player AI-only games successfully without game-breaking errors.
    - Human players rate AI opponents as "challenging" and "believable".

## 5. Risk Mitigation

- **Decision Paralysis**: Implement fallback decision trees for complex scenarios.
- **Predictable Patterns**: Introduce randomization elements to prevent exploitation.
- **Integration Complexity**: Define clear API contracts between the `GameEngine` and `AIDecisionManager`.
